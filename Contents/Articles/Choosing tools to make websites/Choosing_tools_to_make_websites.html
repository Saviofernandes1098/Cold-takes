                            <p>Jan Miksovsky lays out his idea for <a href="https://goodinternetmagazine.com/site-creation-as-content-transformation/">website creation as content transformation.</a> He starts by talking about tools that hide what’s happening “under the hood”:</p>
                            <blockquote>A framework’s marketing usually pretends it is unnecessary for you to understand how its core transformation works — but without that knowledge, you can’t achieve the beautiful range of results you see in the framework’s sample site gallery.</blockquote>
                            <p>This is a great callout. Tools will say, “You don’t have to worry about the details.” But the reality is, you end up worrying about the details — at least to some degree. Why? Because what you want to build is full of personalization. That’s how you differentiate yourself, which means you’re going to need a tool that’s expressive enough to help you.</p>
                            <p>So the question becomes: how hard is it to understand the details that are being intentionally hidden away? A lot of the time those details are not exposed directly. Instead they’re exposed through configuration. But configuration doesn’t really help you learn how something works. I mean, how many of you have learned how typescript works under the hood by using tsconfig.json?</p>
                            
                            <p>As Jan says:</p>
                            <blockquote>Configuration can lead to as many problems as it solves.</blockquote>
                            <p>Nailed it. He continues:</p>
                            <blockquote>Configuring software is itself a form of programming, in fact a rather difficult and often baroque form. It can take more data files or code to configure a framework’s transformation than to write a program that directly implements that transformation itself.</blockquote>
                            <p>I’m not a Devops person, but that sounds like Devops in a nutshell right there. (It also perfectly encapsulates my feelings on trying to setup configuration in GitHub Actions.)</p>
                            
                            <p>Jan moves beyond site creation to also discuss site hosting. He gives good reasons for keeping your website’s architecture simple and decoupled from your hosting provider (something I’ve been a long time proponent of):</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>These site hosting platforms typically charge an ongoing subscription fee.</li>
                                <li>(Some offer a free tier that may meet your needs.) The monthly fee may not be large, but it’s forever.</li>
                                <li>Ten years from now you’ll probably still want your content to be publicly available, but will you still be happy paying that monthly fee?</li>
                                <li>If you stop paying, your site disappears.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In subscription pricing, any price (however small) is recurring. Stated differently: pricing is forever.</p>
                            <p>Anyhow, it’s a good read from Jan and lays out his vision for why he’s building <a href="https://weborigami.org/">Web Origami</a>: a tool for that encourages you to understand (and customize) how you transform content to a website. He just launched <a href="https://github.com/WebOrigami/origami/releases/tag/0.4.0">version 0.4.0</a> which has some exciting stuff I’m excited to try out further (I’ll have to write about all that later).</p>
